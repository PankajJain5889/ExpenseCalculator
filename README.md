# ExpenseCalculator
These is a common mans tool to log and visualize expenses across month and day 

The idea is that you can log all the expenses based on credit or debit and visualize them in order find out your major challenges. 

It needs to be completely over GUI so that any non technical person can use it. 

Preset categories for source of transaction, type and monthly budget. 

One use case would t deploy this over local server so anybody can access as well as log this over the cloud(google drive)
